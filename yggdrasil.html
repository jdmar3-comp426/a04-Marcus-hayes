    <h4>
        <i>Yggdrasil</i>, the World Tree, is the gargantuan tree upon whose branches and roots the Nine Worlds of
        Nordic mythology rest upon, and exists as the center and connection between the entire cosmos. The name <i>Yggdrasil</i>
        translates to "Horse of Odin", referencing an instance when Odin sacrificed himself on the tree by hanging himself,
        stabbed himself with a spear, and hung for days without help, food, and water: all done in order to gain the power and
        knowledge of runes. The sight was said the resemble a horse and rider. Lore suggested that there would come a time when
        Yggdrasil would tremble, and this would indicate the beginning of Ragnarok, a cataclysmic event that would
        destroy the universe.
